# Python MARL framework

## Installation

- Python 3.10
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

PyMARL is [WhiRL](http://whirl.cs.ox.ac.uk)'s framework for deep multi-agent reinforcement learning and includes implementations of the following algorithms:
- [**QMIX**: QMIX: Monotonic Value Function Factorisation for Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.11485)
- [**COMA**: Counterfactual Multi-Agent Policy Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08926)
- [**VDN**: Value-Decomposition Networks For Cooperative Multi-Agent Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05296) 
- [**IQL**: Independent Q-Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.08779)
- [**QTRAN**: QTRAN: Learning to Factorize with Transformation for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05408)

PyMARL is written in PyTorch and uses [SMAC](https://github.com/oxwhirl/smac) as its environment.
